## Minimal API .NET 6
The new .NET 6.0 feature - Minimal APIs - for ASP .NET Core 6 allows you to create APIs with minimal dependency on the WebAPI framework and minimal code and files required for minimalist API development.

Now ASP .NET Core follows other technologies like GO, Python and Node.js that already allowed the creation of APIs with minimal code and dependencies.

As main objectives, the Minimals APIs of the .NET platform allow:

- Reduce code complexity for those just starting out;

- Reduce non-essential features (controllers, routing, filters, etc) that were present in ASP.NET projects;

- Embrace the concept of API-level minimalism;
Be Scalable, ensuring that your application can grow if necessary;
